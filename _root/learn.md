Typing Tutors {#tt}
=============

Now that you've got your spiffy new layout in action, how do you learn
it?

There are a lot of free typing tutor programs and websites out there.
None of them have anything specifically geared toward learning Minimak,
however.

To make it easier to learn the 4-key layout, I've created a word list
focused on the keys that change in that layout.  It's in the download
zip in the _words_ folder.

The best program I've found to use this word list is the free,
cross-platform [TIPP10] typing tutor.  There are instructions in the
README in the _words_ folder on how to add these word lists as
lessons.

If TIPP10 isn't to your liking, here are some programs and sites that
you may find useful instead:

- __[GNU Typist]__ - Simple console-mode tutor
- __[Amphetype]__ - Desktop tutor with detailed typing analysis
- __[TypeRacer]__ - competitive typing website that tracks your scores
- __[Hi-games.net]__ - another competitive site with interesting
  visualizations for other layouts
- __[Key Hero]__ - typing website with detailed typing analysis
- __[Type-fu]__ - a slick, stripped-down website

Here's a [list of other tutors] if none of those are to your liking.

As always, make sure you are using good antivirus, such as [Panda Cloud
Antivirus], as I've come across at least one free typing tutor that
reportedly is infected.  For the best security, I recommend scanning
any downloaded file with the [VirusTotal] site, which scans with 40+
brand-name virus scanners.  they also have an [uploader application]
that can send a file from your desktop for scanning via the Explorer
*Send To* menu.  There's also a [Chrome extension] for scanning
suspicious site links from within [Google Chrome].

How sad is it that [Typing of the Dead], the funnest way to learn
typing, can't be had for less than $55?  There is, however, a [free
demo] still available from PC World.  The demo features the first arcade
level.

Considerations
==============

There are several methods for learning a new layout, depending on how
much effort you're willing to expend, what your work environment looks
like, what your goal is and how fast you want to reach it.  I'll briefly
discuss some of these considerations.

Goals
-----

You don't need to decide how far you're going to go with Minimak
upgrades (4-, 8- or 12-key) to start.  It is always recommended that you
go through them in order.  You are free to stop advancing when you feel
you've reached your goal.

I recommend learning in steps because there's a non-linear relationship
between the number of keys you change and the difficulty of learning.
For example, it's easy to learn two key changes, but the learning curve
becomes much steeper after that.  My experience was that I could cope
with 4 key changes.  After that, my learning would take a big hit if I
added even one more key.  So you will learn faster if you limit each
change to four keys, which is what each of the steps does.

The goal you'll need to eventually decide is how much time you want to
invest and how far from QWERTY you're willing to go.  If you start with
the 4-key layout and decide it feels good enough, you've sacrificed
little from QWERTY but gotten a lot of benefit.   I think the 8-key
layout is the sweet spot, still easy to maintain your QWERTY skills
while getting rid of the worst occupants of the home position (I'm
looking at you, J).  The 12-key layout is aesthetically pleasing,
and does offer improvement, but approaches or crosses the
threshold of diminishing returns.

Work Environment
----------------

If you happen to be on a machine that won't allow you to install
software, you're obviously going to have different requirements than
someone who is the sole administrator and user of their machine.

For those in such an unfortunate situation, you're ok with PKL as long
as you can copy the files onto the machine and run the `pkl.exe`
executable.  It is portable and doesn't need to be installed.  You can
even run it from a USB drive.  You're not going to be able to use the
registry mappings, though.

If you're in a multiuser situation on your machine, you too are going to
want to use PKL so it is only local to your account and doesn't affect
others.  If you happen to be on Windows XP, there are user-specific
registry mappings you can use as well, which you can read about on the
download page.  This can work well since it doesn't affect the layout
for the login screen.  If you're on Vista or 7, there's no user mappings
though.

Otherwise, you're probably eventually going to want to use the boot
mappings.  If you occasionally need to let someone else use the
computer, there are PKL inverse Minimak mappings (8- and 12-key) so you
can hand the keyboard to a QWERTY user without having to reboot.

Speed
-----

If you're gung-ho about learning the 12-key Minimak as quickly as
possible, I still recommend that you take the 4-key upgrades a step at a
time.

If that's not good enough for you, the 6-key layout is a good compromise
that gets you to the 12-key layout in two steps.  It's designed for
learning the 12-key layout quickly, and isn't meant to be used on its
own.  It isn't the best 6-key layout for that purpose.

Method
======

First, measure your current typing speed with a site like [Key Hero].
This will give you a point of reference.

The length of time to gain full proficiency with Minimak varies, but
it's a good bet that it will take a good 2-3 months before you are
typing as fast in Minimak as you do now, depending on which layout you
choose.  However, unlike most other layouts, you'll be able to begin
using it for work almost immediately.

There are three popular methods for learning new layouts.  With other
layouts, these are meant to get you to the point where you're barely
sufficient with the new layout, at which point you stop typing QWERTY.
With Minimak, however, the point is to keep your QWERTY skills.  It's
recommended that you keep typing QWERTY until you can type both layouts
at your old speed (before you started learning Minimak).  Once you've
accomplished that, you can use Minimak most of the time, but I suggest
tuning up QWERTY every once in a while (say, once a month).  You can do
it less if you're on the 4- or 8-key layouts, but the 12-key layout
really needs it.

- __Day on, day off:__  Use QWERTY on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and
  Minimak on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday
- __QWERTY by day, Minimak by night:__  Use QWERTY while you are working
  and Minimak for personal usage
- __Which am I slower at:__ Start each day by measuring your speed at
  both, then work on the one you're slower with

With any of these methods, some people swear that using the new layout
for chat sessions is a surefire way to increase your speed.

The first two methods are pretty self-explanatory.  A lot of people
claim success with the QWERTY by day, [other layout] by night approach.
My opinion is that since you can quickly adopt Minimak without hurting
your work too much, the by day/night approach is less useful than the
day at a time methods.  You might use the by day/night approach for the
first couple days until you feel comfortable though.

I'm a fan of the "which am I slower at" method, because this method
ensures that you keep both sets of skills tuned.  While I'm learning,
I'm using this method.  Each morning I take the median of three
typing tests with each layout, then use the one I'm slowest at
for the day.  That way I never lose my edge with QWERTY.
Another variation is to set a floor beneath which you don't let
QWERTY fall.  You only type Minimak when QWERTY stays above that
floor.
