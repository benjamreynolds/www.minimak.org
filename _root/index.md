# Minimak: A Pragmatic Rethinking of QWERTY

Minimak focuses the keys that matter most.  While Dvorak reduces finger
movement by an admirable 50%, it rearranges 25 keys in the process.
Minimak gets you half of that, but in only _4 keys_.  How would you
rather spend your time?

Minimak is a pragmatic alternative keyboard layout based on QWERTY.  It
is the result of several iterations of design and testing which
intelligently and efficiently fix many of QWERTY's issues.

Minimak is the first design to take a deliberately progressive approach,
offering three layouts, each one building on the last, four keys at a
time.  Minimak only changes the keys which have the greatest impact on
your typing satisfaction.

That means that unlike other layouts, Minimak is both minimalistic and
optimal at each step of the way.  That makes it:

- **Easy -** four keys is the easiest change to learn that still makes
a significant improvement to the layout

- **Flexible -** each Minimak layout is sensible in its own right,
  meaning you have the choice of how much difficulty you are willing to
  take on

- **Optimal -** limiting changes to four keys at a time makes it
possible to find the layout which is objectively best at each step of
the way

- **Adaptable -** by the time you learn Minimak, you haven't lost the
ability to type QWERTY

### The Experience Behind Minimak

Minimak came about after the frustration of trying to learn more than
one alternative keyboard layout.  I first learned to type carPalX's
optimal layout.  It was enjoyable to type with, and I was fast (80 wpm),
but after some time I found I could no longer type QWERTY.  This was
unacceptable, so I relearned QWERTY with the intention of coming back.
I waited a good while before trying a second time, but decided I should
learn Colemak this time since Colemak changes fewer keys.  I broke off
the effort before long however.  I could tell I would still have trouble
with QWERTY if I continued.

My experience was frustrating.  I knew that QWERTY was a bad layout, but
I couldn't give it up entirely.  I decided to see if anyone had taken
this into account, whether there was a layout which only tried to change
the keys which mattered the most.  I didn't find one, so I created
Minimak.

Minimak looks at the metrics agreed upon by most designers, but tries to
get the best result that can be had for changing only a few keys at a
time.  What a surprise it was to learn that not just some, but _most_ of
benefit of other layouts can be achieved in a fraction of the keys.
Minimak provides 90% of the benefit of Dvorak in half the number of
keys.  I found that astonishing and heartening that there could be a
layout which met my criteria.

Unfortunately, a 12 key layout wasn't good enough either.  I wanted to
keep the ability of typing QWERTY but the cost of changing more than a
handful of keys was high.  I found that I could change at most four keys
before my typing became unproductive.  I also found that once I had
learned those four keys, I could still type QWERTY, albeit more slowly.
Changing more than that made QWERTY more difficult, but I figured over
time I could modify more if I did it in steps and kept practicing
QWERTY.

While that's true, and I now type both QWERTY and Minimak's 12-key
layout, I recommend the four-key layout.  12 keys is half the keyboard,
and although it's still closer to QWERTY than any of the popular
layouts, it takes ongoing practice to keep both speedy.  The four-key
layout does so much to fix what's wrong with QWERTY, it's surprising
that no one has tried to do just that: fix what's wrong, not redesign
everything.  Minimak is my attempt to do that.

If you have ever tried to learn an alternative to QWERTY and given up or
gone back to QWERTY afterward, Minimak might be for you.  If you have
ever been interested in improving your layout but were more concerned
with losing productivity, Minimak is worth a try.  If you've been
considering another layout but haven't worked up the courage, try
Minimak.  Even if you are a dedicated user of another layout, you may
benefit from Minimak if you want to regain the ability to use other
computers at native speed.  It doesn't solve world hunger or cure
cancer, but Minimak is a wholly pragmatic layout which lets _you_ set
the difficulty level.

### Claims/Advantages

- **Retain QWERTY skills -** While _any_ layout will slow your QWERTY
speed while you learn, you won't forget QWERTY after learning the first
layout.  If you stay with the 4-key layout, you'll also retain QWERTY
without having to practice.

- **Fix what's wrong with QWERTY in 12 keys -** If you move on to the 8
and 12-key layouts, you'll have a world-class layout which compares
favorably to (but not better than) the best, in 13 fewer keys than
Dvorak and 5 less than Colemak.

- **Learn faster than any other layout -**  Four keys is the optimal
number to change at a time.  The worst sins of QWERTY cannot be fixed in
less than four.  At the same time, five is too many to learn easily.
Through experimentation I've determined that the threshold (for me) of
where a layout becomes cognitively "too different" and the brain stops
trusting muscle memory comes after _four_ keys.

- **Stay productive while learning -** You'll be able to adopt each
successive layout full-time with comparatively little practice.  No
other layout offers such simple, effective changes.  You'll be able to
do productive work using Minimak full-time in a day or two, not days or
weeks.

- **Even on Minimak-12, it's easier to switch to QWERTY -** While the
12-key version requires practice with QWERTY, the layouts are still
closely related.  Only three keys change fingers, keeping your finger
intuition correct most of the time.  In most cases mistakes can be
corrected by the same finger, by either the key above or below.
- **Decide the balance that's right for you -** No other approach lets
you decide how much change you're willing to deal with.

## Measuring Minimak

If there is one thing that's difficult about designing a layout it's
determining how good that layout is.  There are some simple measures
which are indicators, but there's no single number that can objectively
tell you which is best.  I don't know why some designers use black and
white terms claiming their layout is best when it's not possible to say.
At the least, intelligent and reasonable people can and will disagree on
the subject.

After my experiences, I've found the issue to be academic anyway.  Even
if you could measure one thing that would tell you which is best, that
wouldn't address the issues I encountered.  Like it or not, QWERTY is
the universal US layout.  Losing the ability to use it is not acceptable
to most of us.

The only answer for _pragmatically_ improving QWERTY is to build on it.
Since a minimalist approach has to prioritize what it will address, it
makes sense to optimize the metrics which everyone can agree make a
difference.  I'll summarize my thinking here.

One of the most important things you must know before designing a layout
is your usage pattern.  In order to minimize your hand movement, for
example, you need to know which keys are used the most so you can put
those keys in the best spot.

While the usage patterns for English are well documented, I wanted to
make sure that the statistics fit my actual usage pattern, not some
sampling of English which might not resemble my own usage.  So I ran
statistics on ten years of my own emails, using only the text I composed
myself.

I also did wanted to make sure that I had some faith in the metrics I
used.  I tried layout variations which optimized for different metrics
and focused on how a particular one actually felt.  I even developed my
own new metric to take more advanced concepts into account.

In the end, however, I was glad to find both that my usage patterns were
not very different from known English statistics, and that my valuation
of the importance of various metrics did not differ largely from other
valuations I was able to find on the Internet.  Since you get some
measure of faith in your results when they agree with another
independent measure, I will explain mine using a model which you can
verify yourself, the [keyboard layout analyzer].

The keyboard layout analyzer measures a combination of three things in
equal proportion: finger movement distance, how often you use particular
fingers and how often you switch fingers and hands while typing.

_Finger movement distance_ is a measure of how far your fingers have to
physically move around the keyboard to hit the keys as you type.  It's
not the only important metric, but it's a big one and one that makes
intuitive sense.  A keyboard layout should be better if your fingers
move less to type the same amount.

_Finger usage_ is a measure of how many keystrokes each finger makes.
For this measure, I value the pinky being used least, the ring and
middle fingers to be used equally, and the index finger to be used most
since it's responible for six keys apiece rather than three.  While I'm
not sure how the layout analyzer assigns weights, mine is a fairly
standard perspective so I wouldn't be surprised if it were similar.

Finally, _finger and hand alternation_ are actually measures of two
things.  Using the same finger to type multiple letters in a row, also
called _same finger repetition_ is considered to be slower than using
separate fingers.  That's because separate fingers would be able to
position themselves independently.  While one finger is typing, the
other can get into position to press the next key without being forced
to move in-between presses as a single finger would be.

Hand alternation is considered good since using one hand to type
uninterrupted contributes to fatigue and is more likely to cause
uncomfortable hand stretches to reach consecutive keys.  While it's
difficult to prove that point, it makes intuitive sense that having
frequent hand alternation provides more independence, which is a good
thing in general.

I used Chapter 1 of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ to make my
comparisons.  While the usage statistics for my own emails were
different, they differences were not enough to change the outcomes of
the comparisons with other layouts.

Layout | Movement Reduction
-     | -
4-key | 19.6%
Dvorak | 40.0%

12-key gets 35.4%.

Layout | Same Finger Reduction
- | -
4-key | 22.7%


![letter frequency plot]{: style="width: 541px; height: 352px;"}
{: .center}

In contrast, using Dvorak to type the same thing cuts the distance
nearly in half, to about 181 meters.  Since we're talking about how far
your fingers need to move to perform the same task, shorter is better
and Dvorak is a big improvement.

But Dvorak rearranges 25 keys on the keyboard to get that improvement.
How much could you get by only moving 4 keys?

Minimak moves 4 keys for a distance of 242 meters.  While Dvorak is
better, we just got half of its improvement by moving a fraction of the
keys around.  Fewer keys means easier to learn.  So what's up with
Dvorak?

The answer is that it gets a lot harder to improve finger distance after
the first several keys, so Dvorak changes _everything_ just to wring the
last bit of improvement out.  While that may make for great metrics,
it's not great for you.  Wouldn't you rather get most of that and only
have to deal with a few keys moving?

Here are Minimak's overall scores from the [keyboard layout analyzer],
using QWERTY as the baseline and Dvorak as the upper bound:

![kla scores]{: style="width: 450px; height: 320px;"}
{: .center}

As you can see, most of Dvorak's improvement can be gotten at a fraction
of the change.  At 12 keys (half the number that Dvorak changes),
Minimak gives 90% of the benefit.  However you can choose to learn just
the recommended 4-key layout and still get two-thirds of what Dvorak
offers.

If 4 keys don't satisfy you and want to take the next step, you can
learn the 8-key layout, which only changes 4 more keys from the
original.  At each level, the next step is only 4 keys different which
means only 4 new keys to learn.  You can do that practically standing on
your head, especially compared to learning an entire-keyboard layout.

### How It Works

So how does Minimak get so much improvement in 4 keys?  It's got
everything to do with letter frequency.  In English, the letter
frequency distribution looks something like this:

Even though there are 26 letters in the alphabet, you're usually typing
the letters **e**, **t**, **a**, **o**, **i** and **n** most frequently.

Let's look at an example of how to use this information.  If you made a
keyboard where the heights of the keys reflected the frequency of that
usage, it would look like this:

![relief of keyboard]{: style="width: 541px; height: 428px;"}
{: .center}

Look at how tall **e** and **t** are.  Those are very frequently used
keys, and therefore very important.  But they aren't located in the home
position occupied by your hands at rest:

![home position]{: style="width: 500px; height: 310px;"}
{: .center}

Your fingers have to move from the home position to type **e** and
**t**.  It would make more sense if these important keys were under your
fingers to begin with.  If they were, they would contribute nothing to
the finger distance of your typing since your fingers don't have to move
to get to them.

Now go back to the raised keyboard and look at **j** and **k** this
time.  You can't even see them!  They're dwarfed by the other keys.
They're practically begging you not to type them, but there they are
taking up valuable real estate in the home position.

The keys that are used most frequently affect finger distance
disproportionately _if_ they are not properly positioned.  By fixing
those keys first, you get the biggest bang for your buck.

That's one way Minimak finds and fixes the easy wins.  However, don't be
tempted to think because Minimak is minimal that it's also simplistic.
Even when you're dealing with four keys, there are many factors to
consider, including:

- [finger movement distance]
- [same-finger repetition]
- [hand alternation]
- finger strength

Minimak takes all of these into consideration, which is how it rates so
well in overall score on the keyboard layout analyzer.
