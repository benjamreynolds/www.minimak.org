Are you using Minimak?

: Yes.  You can see my latest speed tests at the top of the
homepage.  I try to post them daily.

How fast are you?

: See the homepage.

How long does it take to get up to speed?

: You can also see the count of days I've been using Minimak on the
homepage.  I'm not fully up to speed yet.  After 9 days of using the
12-key layout, I'm in the 40-60 wpm range with both Minimak and QWERTY.
I'm not a good test case though, since I've been typing with other
variations of the same layout for quite some time.

: It took me about six months to get up to 80 wpm with the QGMLWB layout
from carPalx.  I'd estimate Minimak to cut that time to a third.

Which Minimak do you use?

: I'm using the 12-key layout.

Which Minimak do you recommend?

: I think the 8-key layout is the best compromise for most people.  I
like the 12-key layout more for aesthetic reasons than for its actual
metrics.  I think it's further from QWERTY than you need to go, and the
8-key layout gives you the best bang for your learning buck.

How many people are using Minimak?

: There have been about 70 downloads by November 2012, but I'd guess
only a small fraction of that are active users.  I'm looking forward to
more people trying it out.  It really works.

How long has Minimak been in existence?

: The layout was finalized and launched on October 21, 2012.

I want to learn the 12-key layout as fast as possible.  Should I just learn it directly or use the 4-key steps?

: I can't say with total confidence, but I believe the 4-key route is
quicker.  I need more real world experiences to say for sure.

: If you're absolutely gung-ho, I'd say that the 6-key layout is a good
compromise that gets you there in two steps.  It's explicitly designed
for learning the 12-key layout quickly.  Give it a try.

How do you come up with your comparison numbers to Dvorak?

: I use the keyboard layout analyzer to compare each layout with Dvorak.
I'm comfortable with the statistics it generates from the _Alice in
Wonderland_ input that it provides, so I use that so others can
reproduce the analysis more easily.  The download has importable maps
for the layout analyzer, which makes loading them easier.

: Once the layout analyzer does its thing, I look at the difference in
the absolute numbers for QWERTY versus Minimak and QWERTY versus Dvorak.
I do this by computing the ratios of the mathematical differences
(minus) from QWERTY for the two competing layouts.  I look at the
reductions in finger distance and same-finger repetition, then use a
weighted average of 2/3 finger distance and 1/3 finger repetition, which
feels right to me.

Are your metrics subjective?

: Yes, but I think they provide a good assessment of feel, which is the
goal of the design.  The greatest part of it is reduction in finger
movement.  While reduction in finger repetition is also a tangible
concern, it is a less consistent part of the typing experience, hence
the lower weight.

: Other people may argue for more sophisticated metrics, but there's
only so much you can try to improve in a minimalistic approach like
Minimak's, so I question the value of trying to satisfy anything more
sophisticated.  I also question how valuable other metrics actually are.
At the end of the day, you have to actually be able to feel the
differences, and I can only feel finger distance and repetition.

Why compare to Dvorak and not [layout X]?

: I know more people who use Dvorak than any other alternative layout
and it has more hardware keyboard support than any other.

: There are layouts which have better results than Dvorak on my metrics,
notably Colemak.  I don't try to compare to it as well so as not to
confuse things with even more metrics than there already are.  Dvorak
is just a name people can relate to.
