While Minimak is a simple design, the design process has been fairly
involved, becoming more refined over time.

The initial Minimak design came out of the frustration I felt with
learning other keyboard layouts.  I knew there was something better than
QWERTY out there, and my curiosity drove me to find out what was better
(as opposed to any ergonomic issue).  I also wanted the insurance of
doing what I could to avoid injury from typing QWERTY as my job, but
that was a secondary concern.

When I researched the options, I decided against Dvorak since there were
more recent popular designs that seemed to have a lot of research and
momentum behind them.  In particular, [Colemak] and carPalx's
fully-optimized [QGMLWB] designs seemed the most optimized.  I felt that
if I were going to expend the effort of relearning to type, that I
should do it without compromise and go for the best.  CarPalx's models
and analyses were so convincing, I was sure that his layout was best,
and proceeded to learn it.

I spent the next couple months learning the new layout, and about six in
total getting up to my old speed of 80wpm.  During that time, I was
completely focused on getting speed and not on maintaining any QWERTY
skills.  I figured that once I was good with QGMLWB, I could go and get
my QWERTY back without losing the new layout, then just alternate once
and a while.

There ended up being two problems with this.  First, getting QWERTY back
wasn't so easy, and second, I couldn't always do my job in the meantime.
