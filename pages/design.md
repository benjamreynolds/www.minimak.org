The Problem With QWERTY
=======================

QWERTY has a pretty bad rep.  Here are some of the accusations leveled
at it:

To be fair, I'm taking Darryl's quote (the first one) out of context
since he's in the process of making the case _for_ QWERTY, but his
characterization is typical of what's said against it.

I don't agree with all of these points.  Some of them are if not
incorrect, at least arguable, such as the one about QWERTY being
designed around the word "typewriter".  It's true that the letters of
the word appear in the top row, but there's no record I could find
stating that as a design goal.  At best it's conjecture and it doesn't
really make sense when you know the story.  Nevertheless, points such as
this are widely repeated as to why QWERTY is such a blight on the
computing landscape.

I've read several and varying accounts of QWERTY's origins, both from
supporters' and detractors' viewpoints.  As best I can tell, QWERTY was
a very early design which did not benefit from a lot of work on
ergonomics and efficiency, it's true.  It was designed before the advent
of touch-typing, so it most certainly could not have applied any design
principles whose goal was touch-typing efficiency.  At best, if there
was thought toward typing efficiency, it involved the efficiency of the
hunt-and-peck style which itself was becoming possible for the first
time.  Any efficiency imparted to touch-typing would have had to be
incidental (perhaps some overlap in what makes typing better for both
styles).

By all accounts, even efficiency concerns with hunt-and-peck typing
would have been secondary, if having registered at all.  The designers
were still coming to grips with the mechanical design of the machine,
and mechanical issues impacted the layout.  It's commonly said that the
arrangement of the keys allowed typists to type fast enough that the key
hammers would jam, and that the designers rearranged the keys to slow
the typist down.

I find this hard to believe.  The hammers certainly could jam, as anyone
who has used a hammer-based model knows.  However, if the keys were
dispersed to prevent the most common bigrams from being quickly keyed,
then they would have surely moved the number one most frequent bigram,
the pair of "E" and "R" (in either order), to be on the same finger so
as not to be typed quickly.  At the least they wouldn't have put them
right together on two of the quickest typing fingers.

Similarly, they would have moved "T" and "H", the second most common
bigram, to a similar situation.  These frequent bigrams would have
surfaced empirically through routine typing while they worked on the
layout, without the need for in-depth frequency analyses that would only
come later.  They could have and would have been addressed then.

The keys were moved from their original positions, but not to slow the
typists' keying.  The keys were moved because they were attached to a
ring of hammers by their position, and the best positions for frequent
bigrams were to be on opposite sides of the ring so that they could be
typed quickly without jamming.  While I can't go back and study the
design to verify my theory on the most frequent pairs, this is the
explanation given by some texts and the one I find most plausible.

Whatever thought was given to typing efficiency, the only efficient part
of the design seems to be the placement of the little-used "Q" and "Z"
in corners and of other infrequent keys on the bottom row.  The home row
is poorly utilized, appearing to have mostly come from an alphabetical
arrangement ("d-fgh-jkl").  This is where touch-typists are trained to
keep their hands most of the time, where efficiency would dictate
putting the most frequently used keys.  Hint: they aren't.  So I think
it's safe to say that QWERTY has no great stress on touch-typing
efficiency principles.

There's much more debate about why QWERTY then succeeded against other
designs of the time.  A lot has been said about the market forces that
create what may be the self-perpetuating success of a universal standard
layout.  What's important to note is that there was a period of time
before there was a clear universal standard, and while QWERTY's
competition may have had better or worse design, QWERTY's was good
enough for people to type successfully and reasonably fast.  It's still
true to this day.

While there are layouts that have clearly better research and efficiency
principles employed in their design, QWERTY typists still hold
championship positions in the typing world.  Sure, there are Dvorak
Guiness record holders as well, but if QWERTY were bad, truly bad, then
there would be a distinct and statistically obvious advantage for the
Dvorak users.  76 years after Dvorak's invention, there should be clear
evidence that its best users can handily beat QWERTY's best, and it's
just not so.  You can't write it off to lack of talent pool, as there
seem to be plenty of Dvorak users, especially among computer enthusiasts
who are presumably very experienced typists.

So QWERTY's success boils down to, it's not great, but it's not bad
enough to justify replacing it.  If you've read this far just to be told
something you already knew, then I hope you're at least a bit more
educated about why.  It's not great because it wasn't designed to
be...it's best innovations were to simply use three rows of keys instead
of two and to place the frequent bigrams where their hammers would
interfere least.

To get down to brass tacks, here's what I find most wrong with QWERTY:

- The home row is underutilized, forcing the typist to move frequently
  to the top row
- The two most-frequent letters, which are disproportionately relied on
  by the English language, are undeservingly denied the most favorable
  positions on the keyboard as well as appearing on the same hand,
  adding insult to injury
- Some but not all of the worst keyboard positions are given to
  infrequent letters - all of them should be
- There are many frequently-used bigrams that are located on the same
  finger for touch-typists, slowing them down
- Some frequently-used bigrams cause the hand to have to awkwardly jump
  between the top and bottom rows

In particular, "E" and "T" should be located on the middle finger of
each hand.  More of the top row letters should be moved to the home row.
And the letters that switch fingers should be moved where they don't
cause same-finger repetition.

The Problem With Alternative Layouts
====================================

If lack of intentional design were the only problem, then there would be
no need for a new layout such as Minimak.
