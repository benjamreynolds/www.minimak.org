My Experience
=============

I started looking at keyboard layouts mostly out of curiosity.  While
many people are motivated by physical issues, I just had a vague
conception that QWERTY wasn't very well designed.  I wasn't motivated by
a desire to use something better for the sake of it being better
although it's tempting.  Rather, I was curious as to how much of a
difference could there be.  Learning a layout is hard.  Is there enough
benefit to bother learning?  This is the question I wanted to answer
most.  And I didn't want the answer to be colored by the effort
invested.

I figured that I would go through the pain of learning a new layout just
to answer that question.  I figured that I would research the options,
choose the best I could find, learn it and then see how I felt about it.
If I didn't feel there was a huge benefit, then I'd go back to QWERTY
satisfied.  Or I'd stick with the new layout since I'd already made the
investment, but I could tell others from my experience whether it was a
worthwhile effort.

The short version of this story is that I decided there was not enough
benefit to learning a new layout, at least for someone who didn't have a
physical issue.  However this conclusion bothered me.  After all, I
knew there was much improvement to be made.  It was simply outweighed
by two things, one which I knew beforehand, and the other I learned as
part of the experience.

The first was that it's really hard to learn a layout, harder than I
expected.  I was very gung-ho and forced myself to start using my new
layout within a few days of starting practice, immersing myself in it.
It still took me about six months of using it to get up to my old speed
of around 80wpm.  I'm not slow but I'm no Olympic athlete at it either.
That's a pretty long time...and although the new layout was great, it
wasn't so great that it was worth all the frustration and lost
productivity.

This brings me to the second, unexpected point.  I figured that my
QWERTY skills would be safe after having touch-typed for 20+ years.  I
was wrong.  I immersed myself in the new layout for speed of learning,
but didn't work on maintaining QWERTY.  After a couple months, I
could only type QWERTY by keeping my eyes on the keyboard.  If I
didn't, I was no longer a QWERTY typist at all without total focus.
The skills weren't gone, but they were buried out of reach.

My job requires me to work with other peoples' computers on occasion.
It's not what I do all the time, but I can't be incapable of doing it
at a professional level.  Learning an alternate layout had taken away
this vital skill.  Even if I had committed myself to the new layout
beyond a learning experience, I would have had to either abandon it for
this reason or at least rehab my QWERTY skills.

I did switch back to QWERTY with the intention of rehabing my skills,
but it took too long to get them back, another couple months of slow
typing.  At this point I knew it was simply too hard to try to keep
both sets of skills.  The layouts were too different.  I know there
are people who are capable of it, and I could be if I were determined,
but I knew that if I couldn't justify the expense of learning the new
layout on it's own merits, I couldn't justify the added effort of
maintaining QWERTY on top of that.  So I gave up and left the
alternative layout.  I haven't typed it since.

As I said earlier, this conclusion bothered me.  If it wasn't worth
learning an entire new layout but there was improvement to be made,
couldn't there be another answer?  After several months, I revisited the
topic again.  I figured that there may be a design that lowers the
learning curve by being more similar to QWERTY.  I decided to see
whether the Colemak layout would be any better, since claims to be
friendlier to QWERTY, only changing 17 of 27 possible QWERTY keys.

I spent a few days learning Colemak but quickly became frustrated.  17
keys might as well have been 27.  There was no way to learn it without
being slowed the same as a 27-key layout.  At least, that's how it felt.
So I gave up on Colemak as well and that was that.

A New Strategy
==============

The question wouldn't leave me alone.  One night, an idea came to me.
What if you only allowed key changes that allowed the key to stay on the
same finger?  I'd noticed while learning the various layouts that I
seemed to have less trouble with keys that were on the same finger as
before.

It seemed reasonable to me that preserving these pre-wired finger
impulses would help...you'd still get the keys wrong as you learn, but
the difference would be that you would fix your mistakes much more
easily since the correct key was no longer at a random other location.
Instead, it was under the same finger which had missed, you just needed
to tell it to hit one of the other keys.  Even if you weren't sure where
the key really was, most of the time you only had one or two other keys
to choose from anyway (except on the index finger), so most of the time
you could fake your way into hitting the correct key without really
knowing where it actually was.

So the first Minimak layout was born.  The name came from the idea of
trying to make the best improvement you could from the smallest, easiest
change to QWERTY, the minimum change with the maximum benefit.  The
"minimax" concept got the "ak" ending from Dvorak tacked on as a nod to
the other layout, same as Colemak's.

So if you're going to keep keys on the same fingers, then except for the
index fingers, you're limited to swapping rows.  By adding two more
limitations, I'd make it even easier: keys could only be swapped between
the top and home rows, and the index finger would limit swaps to the
same column for consistency.  Thus the auto-correction reflex could be
developed uniformly.

I realized one more important thing as well.  When the keys are limited
to row swaps, more of your existing motor skills are preserved when
neighboring keys are transposed at the same time.  For example, when you
type the letters "er" (or "re"), you're typing the most frequently
paired letters in English.  If you move one but not both of them to the
home row, you're changing the way you have to type them.  Your fingers
are no longer tapping two keys in the same row, they now have to type
one character in the home row then one in the top row.  This is harder
to learn than moving them both to the home row at once, because the
finger motion is closer to the original when you do so.  Both letters
are in the same place relative to one another.

This means that it's easier to move more letters together than it is to
move them separately.  It's still more to learn than if you moved fewer
keys instead, but there's a forgiveness factor to moving keys as a
block.  So a 10-key row swap is easier to learn than ten random key
changes.  Much easier, as it turns out.  While this concept didn't make
it into the final Minimak design, it created the first Minimak.

So the first Minimak was based on the row-swapping idea.  The only thing
to figure out was which keys to swap.  The most basic thing to optimize
when looking at typing is finger travel.  Finger travel is a measure of
how far your fingers have to move to type each key, the sum of which
measures a distance.  Any given sequence of letters will give you a
certain distance, and since I type in English, the best way to reduce
travel is to take the most frequently used characters in English and to
put them in the home position, if possible.

So I researched the letter frequencies in English.  More on that later,
but the result told me how poorly QWERTY was actually designed.  As
it turns out, on balance you are better off _swapping the entire top
row for the home row_.  With the exceptions of A, S and H, _all_ of
the keys in the home row would be better served by the row above.  I
was totally astonished by this.

Yes, perhaps you'd want to not swap ASH, but on the other hand, if you
weigh losing those against gaining the rest of the top row, the math
isn't even close.  And if moving the entire top row has the benefit of
not changing the relative positions of the keys within their rows, so
that's what the initial Minimak almost was.  My urge to optimize won
however, so A, S and H got to keep their positions while the rest moved
down.
