Typing Tutors {#tt}
=============

Now that you've got your spiffy new layout in action, how do you learn
it?

Here are some programs and sites that you may find useful for typing
practice:

- [GNU Typist] - Simple console-mode tutor
- [TypeRacer] - typing website
- [Key Hero] - another typing website

Here's a [list of other tutors] if none of those are to your liking.

As always, make sure you are using good antivirus, such as [Panda Cloud
Antivirus], as we've come across at least one free typing tutor that
reportedly is infected.  For the best security, we recommend scanning
any downloaded file with the [VirusTotal] site, which scans with 40+
brand-name virus scanners.  they also have an [uploader application]
that can send a file from your desktop for scanning via the Explorer
*Send To* menu.  There's also a [Chrome extension] for scanning
suspicious site links from within [Google Chrome].

How sad is it that [Typing of the Dead], the funnest way to learn
typing, can't be had for less than $55?  There is, however, a [free
demo] still available from PC World.  The demo features the first arcade
level.

First, measure your current typing speed with a site like
[Typeracer](http://www.typeracer.com).  This will give you a point of
reference.

The length of time to gain full proficiency with Minimak varies, but
it's a good bet that it will take a good 4-6 months before you are
typing as fast in Minimak as you normally do.

The recommended way to learn Minimak is to start with [Portable Key Layout](/download#pkl).  Download and unzip it, then run `pkl.exe`.
