Typing Tutors {#tt}
=============

Now that you've got your spiffy new layout in action, how do you learn
it?

Here are some programs and sites that you may find useful for typing
practice:

- __[GNU Typist]__ - Simple console-mode tutor
- __[Amphetype]__ - Desktop tutor with detailed typing analysis
- __[TypeRacer]__ - competitive typing website that tracks your scores
- __[Hi-games.net]__ - another competitive site with interesting
  visualizations for other layouts
- __[Key Hero]__ - typing website with detailed typing analysis
- __[Type-fu]__ - a slick, stripped-down website

Here's a [list of other tutors] if none of those are to your liking.

As always, make sure you are using good antivirus, such as [Panda Cloud
Antivirus], as I've come across at least one free typing tutor that
reportedly is infected.  For the best security, I recommend scanning
any downloaded file with the [VirusTotal] site, which scans with 40+
brand-name virus scanners.  they also have an [uploader application]
that can send a file from your desktop for scanning via the Explorer
*Send To* menu.  There's also a [Chrome extension] for scanning
suspicious site links from within [Google Chrome].

How sad is it that [Typing of the Dead], the funnest way to learn
typing, can't be had for less than $55?  There is, however, a [free
demo] still available from PC World.  The demo features the first arcade
level.

Considerations
==============

There are several methods for learning a new layout, depending on how
much effort you're willing to expend, what your work environment looks
like, what your goal is and how fast you want to reach it.  I'll briefly
discuss some of these considerations.

Goals
-----

You don't need to decide how far you're going to go in the progression
(beginner, intermediate, advanced) to start.  It is always recommended
that you go through them in order and there's no shortcut, so you are
free to stop advancing when you feel you've reached your goal.

I recommend this because you learn faster by doing it in smaller steps
than you can all at once.  There's a non-linear relationship between the
number of keys you change and the difficulty of learning.  It's easy to
learn two key changes, but the learning curve becomes much steeper after
that.  That was my experience in learning the dozens (literally) of
layout variations I created before the final Minimak.  My typing ability
would hit its limit to adapt at 4 key changes.  After that it would slow
to a crawl if I added even one more key.  So you will learn faster if
you limit each change to four keys, which is what the beginner and
intermediate layouts do.

The goal you'll need to eventually decide is how much time you want to
invest and how far from QWERTY you're willing to go.  Intermediate
should be good for most people and offers a lot of benefits.  Advanced
is really just for the hardcore who are willing to sacrifice their
QWERTY abilities to some degree.  The amount of change with advanced is
higher and while the payoff is tangible, it's much lower per relearned
key.  Basic is certainly worthwhile and although it doesn't change much,
it has the highest bang for the buck by far, so it is a perfectly
reasonable stopping point as well.  That said, I use advanced.

Work Environment
----------------

If you work on a machine that won't allow you to install software, 
your obviously going to have different requirements than someone who is
the sole administrator and user of their machine.

For those in such an unfortunate situation, you're ok with PKL as long
as you can copy the files onto the machine and run the `pkl.exe`
executable.  It is portable and doesn't need to be installed.  You can
even run it from a USB drive.  You're not going to be able to use the
registry mappings, though.

If you're in a multi-user situation on your machine, you too are going
to want to use PKL so it is only local to your account and doesn't
affect others.  If you happen to be on Windows XP, there are
user-specific registry mappings you can use as well, which you can read
about on the download page.  This can work well since it doesn't affect
the layout for the login screen (QWERTY).  If you're on Vista or 7,
there's no user mappings though.

Otherwise, you're probably eventually going to want to use the boot
mappings.  If you occasionally need to let someone else use the
computer, you can use PKL's inverse mappings to hand the keyboard to a
QWERTY user without having to reboot.

Speed
-----

If you're gung-ho about learning the Minimak as quickly as possible,
you're going to want to adopt it full-time from the git-go.  The only
way to do this is to start with basic and go through the progression
as you feel comfortable.  If you're a fast learner, you may be able
to get back up to speed in as little as a month or so.  I'm not a
fast learner.

I really don't suggest this, however.  From experience, I can tell you
the frustration of forgetting how to type QWERTY quickly, and that's
what will happen.  You have to alternate between Minimak and QWERTY to
learn both.

Method
======

First, measure your current typing speed with a site like [Typeracer].
This will give you a point of reference.

The length of time to gain full proficiency with Minimak varies, but
it's a good bet that it will take a good 2-6 months before you are
typing as fast in Minimak as you do now.  However, unlike most other
layouts, you'll be able to begin using it for work almost immediately.
