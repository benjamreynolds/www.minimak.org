The recommended way to learn MiniMak is to start with [Portable Key Layout]
(download#pkl).  Download and unzip it, then run `pkl.exe`.

PKL will show up at the bottom screen in the full MiniMak mode.  Go to
the system tray, find the PKL icon (the M in a box from the logo),
right-click it and select *Change Layout*.

You're now in MiniMak-l.  MiniMak-l is the left-hand-only variant which
only switches E, R and T with D, F and G, as in this diagram:

The blue keys are unchanged from QWERTY.  Notice that the yellow and
green keys have just been swapped.

Start by going through some basic exercises that stress the left hand.
You can sometimes find such exercises in your favorite typing tutor.
See the [download page](download#tt) for a list of typing tutors.  If
you just want some practice without loading a new program on your
machine, try typing some samples from this [list of left-handed words]
(http://www.rickwalton.com/wordplay/qwertasd.htm).
