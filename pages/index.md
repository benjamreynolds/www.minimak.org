The Advantages of Dvorak, Without Giving Up On QWERTY
=====================================================

_The Minimak 4-key layout gives 60% of the improvements of Dvorak by
changing just 4 keys from QWERTY_

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently than others:

- __Focuses on the keys that matter:__  Minimak only changes keys that
  make a significant difference in typing.  Other layouts overoptimize,
  trying to squeeze tiny improvements out of large numbers of key
  changes.
- __Changes fewer keys:__ Because many key changes don't make sense,
  Minimak is able to change only 12 keys in the full layout, while still
  giving the majority of the benefit of other layouts.
- __Preserves finger impulses:__ Of the 12 keys that do change, _only 3_
  move to a different finger.  This makes it far easier to correct
  yourself as you learn, and therefore you learn faster.  Your initial
  impulses are still good, they just need to be modified.
- __Can be learned in steps:__  Minimak's layout is designed to be
  learned in increments of 4- or 6-key swaps, at your decision.  4-key
  increments allow you to use it quickly in your everyday life, while
  offering the best improvements that can be had at each step.
- __Can be used at any level:__  You don't have to learn the full 12-key
  layout, you can stop at any level you're comfortable with.  If you're
  on the 4-key or 8-key levels, you're already using the best layout
  possible for that number of key-swaps.
- __Is QWERTY-friendly:__  Because of the low number of key changes and
  the minimal number of finger changes, you're easily able to preserve
  and switch to your QWERTY typing skills.

_The Minimak 8-key layout gives about 75% of the improvement of Dvorak_
{: style="text-align:center;" }

All of these elements combine to form a layout that is manageable for
anyone to learn while providing considerable improvement in finger
distance, same-finger repetition and same-hand row jumps.  Consider the
following metrics:

|Metric                 |Minimak (full) |Simplified Dvorak  |Colemak  |
|:-                     |:-             |:-                 |:-       |
|Keys changed           |12             |27                 |17       |
|Fingers changed        |3              |24                 |13       |
|Weighted Improvement   |36%            |43%                |48%      |
|=                      |=              |=                  |=        |
|Improvement/Key        |3%             |1.6%               |2.8%     |
{: style="margin:0 auto;" }

While it may seem remarkable that Minimak's per-key improvement is
better than the others, that's not what's remarkable.  Per-key
improvement is highest with the first 4-key layout and goes down from
there.  This makes sense because if you're designing the layout
correctly, you're using up the best key changes first.

What's remarkable is that with 12 keys you get most of the improvement
in the Colemak and Dvorak layouts, plus nowhere near the number of
letters changing fingers.  This shows that _you don't need to throw out
QWERTY, you just need to fix it._

These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer] using
Chapter 1 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text, but
these results bear out against a number of sample inputs representative
of everyday English usage.  "Weighted Improvement" is combination of the
improvement in finger distance (2/3) and same-finger repetition (1/3).
