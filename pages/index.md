Minimak is a keyboard layout that was created to address the
shortcomings of existing layout alternatives:

- __Learning a new layout is extraordinarily difficult.__  It can take
  months to relearn touch-typing with a new layout.  Minimak was made to
  be easy enough to learn that you can adopt it immediately with an
  absolute minimum of practice time. 
- __You can't change the layout on every machine you use.__  Once you
  learn an alternative layout, you don't want to use QWERTY any more,
  but you still have to on other machines.  You end up hating to type
  QWERTY at all because you're not good at it any more.  Minimak allows
  you to experience improved typing while making it as easy as possible
  to maintain your QWERTY skills.
- __Existing layouts tend to be exercises in theory.__  While some
  layouts take into account the fact that you already know QWERTY, most
  throw out your QWERTY skills in favor of a clean slate.  Even ones
  that try to pay some mind to QWERTY still expect you to relearn the
  majority of keys.  They try to answer the question of what the best
  layout is, but they start from a vacuum, ignoring your current skills.
  Minimak answers the question of how to fix what you already know
  without throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

These three points are interrelated, and Minimak addresses all three
with a single design philosophy.  Minimak starts with the QWERTY layout
and prioritizes the changes that provide _the maximum impact on your
typing experience_.  The name Minimak comes from this philosophy of
getting the maximum improvement from the minimum change.  That, and a
nod to some of the layouts that came before it, namely Dvorak and
Colemak.

Minimak is really not one but three layouts that are progressive in
nature; basic, intermediate and advanced.  They balance two competing
goals.  The first is the effort of learning a new layout.  The closer to
QWERTY, the easier to learn and to be able to switch back to QWERTY when
necessary.  The competing goal is the improvement in the feel of your
typing.  With that, the further you get from QWERTY, the better you can
do.

Minimak allows you to choose the balance that is right for you.  You can
stop at basic or move on to intermediate and advanced as you see fit.
Because they are built progressively, each step to the next is as simple
as possible.  Compared to QWERTY, Minimak basic changes just 4 keys
which is about as easy as it can get while still offering considerable
advantages.

Intermediate is the recommended level.  It changes only 7 keys from
QWERTY.  It offers the best bang while still making it easy to maintain
QWERTY skills.  It's referred to as just plain "Minimak" since it's the
recommended level.

For those who are willing to sacrifice closeness to QWERTY for improved
feel, there's advanced which changes 13 keys.  This is pretty much past
the point of diminishing returns, which is why intermediate is the
recommended layout.  The incremental improvement for each new key drops
precipitously after the first 7.  If the first couple levels serve to
whet your appetite and you want further improvements, advanced
compares favorably with "from scratch" layouts while changing fewer keys
and without throwing away your existing investment in Minimak.

If you're concerned that QWERTY is too broken to be fixed in so few
keys, then rest assured that Minimak provides the majority of the value
of other layouts in far fewer keys.  A detailed analysis of the design
is offered (work in progress, not posted yet), with statistics and
comparisons to alternatives.  Perhaps more compelling than that is your
own experience...Minimak is simple to try and offers a change in feel
that is unmistakable and immediate.  The advanced layout feels
indistinguishable from the best layout I've learned, but try the basic
layout for a while and see for yourself.

Experiences with Alternative Keyboard Layouts
=============================================

In 2011, during the course of researching ergonomic keyboards, I came
across the concept of alternative keyboard layouts.  I'd been familiar
with the idea in the form of the oldest popular alternative called
[Dvorak], but I never gave it much thought.  After all, if you know how
to touch-type QWERTY, you really know all you need to know to use a
keyboard and besides, it's _really_ hard to learn how to touch-type,
which you have to relearn whenever you try changing your
layout.  So I'd never given it much thought.

The idea stuck with me for whatever reason, and later I came back to it.
I felt the need to take on a new challenge, and changing keyboard layout
certainly qualified. I did a bit of research and was really impressed
with [CarpalX].  The amount of thought and effort that went into the
modeling of keystrokes captured my imagination.  I went whole-hog and
spent months learning the "fully-optimized" [QGMLWB] layout.  I
considered other layouts like [Colemak], but figured that if I was going
to learn a new layout, then I was going to be using it for the rest of
my typing career, so I might as well take the pains to learn the best
layout (I'd later change my mind and go on to recommend Colemak instead
for anyone interested in learning a new layout).

After several months, I got to the point where I could type in my new
layout as fast as I had in QWERTY.  At that point, I learned two
important things.  The first was that the new layout was fantastic!
Typing felt smooth in a way I'd never experienced.  I would later learn
that this is not necessarily because the new layout was so great (it
was), but that QWERTY is really designed just _terribly_.

The second thing I learned is that I'd forgotten how to type QWERTY.  I
was so focused on getting up to speed with the new layout that I never
practiced QWERTY.  As a result, I lost it.  Not completely, but I was
stuck back hunting and pecking most of the time.  I'd been touch-typing
for 20+ years but I couldn't just switch between layouts at will.

I figured I'd go back to QWERTY full-time, get up to speed again and
then switch between layouts until I could do them both at will.  It took
months again before I was back at full speed with QWERTY though.  At
that point, I simply wasn't willing to go back to the new layout.  It
was too painful.

Fast forwarding several more months, I decided perhaps I should have
learned a layout more closely related to QWERTY in the hopes that it
would make it easier to learn and to switch.  After all, you can't just
ignore that every other computer you will possibly use will make you
type QWERTY, and you can't walk around installing keyboard layouts on
every machine you encounter.

So I tried Colemak.  After a couple days, it was no easier or better
than trying to learn any other layout.  At that point, I gave up hope on
the existing alternatives.

The Reason for Minimak
======================

These experiences made me take a hard look at QWERTY.  I mean, couldn't
something be done with it?  And exactly what was so bad?  Here's some of
what I found.

Did you know that because of QWERTY your fingers travel 24% more than
they should?  And I was _really_ surprised to learn that almost half of
the inefficiency of the QWERTY layout is due to just 2 keys.  _2 keys!!_
__E__ and __T__ are the two most frequently-typed keys, so much so that
by themselves, they count for 14 other keys put together.  That's right,
you spend more time typing these two letters than over half of the
rest of the alphabet.  And third place isn't even really close to
these two.

Good design would say that you'd want these two keys where your fingers
don't have to work to reach them.  You'd probably even want them on
different hands to balance things out, perhaps on your strongest fingers
since they'll be doing a hefty chunk of your typing.  But where are
these workhorse keys?  In the home position, where your finger rest?  Of
course not!  Well, at least they aren't on the same hand.  Wait, what,
they are?  Well, yes, it seems they are.

Minimak is supported on Windows.  Mac and Linux versions are in the
works.
