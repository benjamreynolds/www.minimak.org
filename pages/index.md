Minimak is a layout, which is an arrangement of keys on your keyboard,
but you don't need a new keyboard to use it.  Windows, Linux and
MacOS all support software-based methods of changing your layout.

Minimak is a layout "for the rest of us".  While there are many
alternative keyboard layouts, few if any are designed with the average
user in mind.  Almost all of them expect you to toss out your QWERTY
skills and learn an entirely new layout from scratch.

The fact is, using an alternative to QWERTY is a non-starter for most of
us.  Layouts all seem to be designed with the idea that you won't need
QWERTY after learning a new layout.  But that's just not true.  Even if
you do use another layout on your computer, who wants to forget how to
touch-type on 99.99999% of computers out there?  That's what happens
when you use a layout that bears no relation to QWERTY.

Not only that, it's ridiculously hard to learn a new layout.  Do you
remember how hard it was to learn to touch-type in the first place?
Well, it's still that hard, or harder, to learn another layout.  So why
would you do it?

At this point, most of the advocates against QWERTY will tell you that
QWERTY is tremendously inefficient.  They'll mention how it was designed
by typewriter manufacturers to slow you down, a relic of days lost in
the mists of time.

While this may be true, the vast majority of users don't care.  QWERTY
works well enough once you learn it.  Why would you want to learn
another layout when you're still going to have to type QWERTY?  Is it
really going to be so much faster or ergonomic?

I set out to answer the same questions for myself.  After learning not
one but many different layouts, as well as designing several, I can tell
you that my answer to these questions was no, it's not worth it.  That's
why I came up with Minimak.

Minimak isn't a layout that tries to be the best, most ergonomic and
efficient.  Instead, it tries to be the minimal change that only
addresses the worst failings of QWERTY.  The name "Minimak" references
that concept, combined with a nod to Colemak and Dvorak, two other
layouts that inspired it.

There may be no reason to learn an entirely new layout to replace
QWERTY, but there's also no reason you have to put up with the worst
parts of QWERTY either.  And yes, QWERTY does suck.

Minimak is simple to learn, fixes real issues with QWERTY and makes it
easy to maintain your QWERTY typing skills.

There are some free Windows-based downloads which you can use to do the
remapping for you in the [download](/download) section.  They are
provided AS IS and you should read all of the information on that page
before using them, since remapping your keyboard can cause difficulties
if not done with care.
