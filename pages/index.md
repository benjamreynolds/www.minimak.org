Minimak - Minimum Effort, Maximum Efficiency
============================================

What happened to Minimak?
-------------------------

Minimak went through a minor revision, and then was given some
time for dissemination.  During that time, I worked on a more full
layout remapping for my personal use.

Surprisingly, the result of that experimentation was not a 
better remapping of the entire keyboard.  Instead,
I just got a better understanding of what really makes a difference
and what doesn't.

As a result, I determined that QWERTY
*really isn't all that bad*, it just gets one or two things very
wrong.  I found that you don't actually have to
remap your entire keyboard to get the best advantages of the popular
layout alternatives today.  You just have to fix some of the more egregious issues with
QWERTY with some judicious tweaking.

The result is a new Minimak, more
intelligently laid out and with far fewer key changes.  While that means
it's less to learn than most other layouts, I've only found the learning
curve to be on par with that of the original layout despite its fewer keys.
That's because it doesn't follow the original's finger-impulse retention
scheme.  Maintaining QWERTY skills along
with regular QWERTY skills should be on par and easy enough as well.

Of course, it bears little resemblance to the former Minimak
design, so much of what was discussed on the site before is
in the process of being updated.  I apologize to anyone who is
disappointed with the new materials, as they are replacing the
old ones.  The old ones are no longer available as they are clearly
superseded by the new design.  Thanks for your understanding and
I hope you are interested enough to give the new design a try.

If you are a Linux user interesed in the original Minimak layout,
Leonardo Cecchi has [forked the original repository](https://github.com/leonardoce/minimak/tree/master/linux)
and created an xmodmap layout with directions for usage.

What is Minimak?
----------------

Minimak is a keyboard layout.  It's not software or hardware, it's just
an arrangement of keys on your computer keyboard.  You don't need a new
keyboard to use it, though.  Windows,
Linux and MacOS all support software-based methods of changing your layout.

There are some free Windows-based downloads which you can use to do
the remapping for you in the [download](/download) section.  They are
provided AS IS and you should read all of the information on that page
before using them, since remapping your keyboard can cause difficulties
if not done with care.

Ok, so how do I get started?
============================

The easiest way to get started with Minimak is to go to the [Download](download) page.
