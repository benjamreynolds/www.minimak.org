The Benefit of Dvorak Without Losing Your Investment in QWERTY
==============================================================

![Minimak 4-key Layout]  
_The Minimak layout gives 60% of the benefit of Dvorak while
changing just 4 keys from QWERTY.  Think about that for a moment._

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently:

- __Dramatically cuts the learning curve:__  Don't want to invest months
  into learning a foreign layout?  Get 60% of the benefit of Dvorak
  right now by switching just 4 keys!  Because two of them are the most
  frequently used letters in the alphabet, E and T, you'll have them
  down in no time.
- __Compares favorably with other layouts:__  While 60% is a huge
  benefit for 4 keys (what is Dvorak doing with those other 21 keys
      anyway?), you can further improve your typing experience with
  layout "upgrades" which achieve up to 83% of the benefit of Dvorak.
- __Upgrades incrementally:__  Each upgrade changes only 4 keys at a
  time, ensuring your learning experience is as quick and painless as
  possible.  You can learn each upgrade without having to practice much
  before adopting them into your routine.  This speeds the process as a
  whole, because your learning can mostly be done while you're on the
  job.
- __Changes fewer keys:__  If you decide that the original 4-key Minimak
  layout feels good enough, then stay with it.  It's still a huge
  improvement.  If you go to the final upgrade however, you're getting
  83% of the benefit of Dvorak for only 12 keys.  That's less than half
  the keyboard. Dvorak changes _13 more keys than that_, just to eke out
  that last 17%.
- __Has multiple dimensions of QWERTY friendliness:__  If you go with
  the 4-key layout, then there isn't even a discussion.  Once you're
  proficient, you're still going to be able to type QWERTY, maybe just a
  little slower when you switch between QWERTY and Minimak on occasion.
  Even the 12-key layout is easier to maintain alongside your QWERTY
  skills compared to most layouts, which share nothing with QWERTY.  But
  that alone doesn't explain Minimak's QWERTY friendliness.  In all
  incarnations, Minimak only moves _3 keys_ to different fingers.  The
  rest mostly just swap rows.  Because of this, you correct yourself by
  trying the same finger on a different row and it works in most cases.
  This becomes an automatic reflex when you make a mistake, which
  tremendously speeds both the initial learning process as well as the
  mental switch back to QWERTY when necessary.

![Minimak 8-key Layout]  
_The Minimak 8-key layout gives about 75% of the improvement of Dvorak_

All of these elements combine to form a layout that is manageable for
anyone to learn, is extremely QWERTY-friendly and still provides
considerable improvement in finger movement distance, same-finger
repetition and same-hand row jumps.

Consider the following metrics:

|Metric                 |Minimak 4-key  |Minimak 12-key |Dvorak   |
|-                      |-              |-              |-        |
|__Cost__                                                         |
|Keys changed           |4              |12             |25       |
|Fingers changed        |3              |3              |23       |
|__Benefit__                                                      |
|Weighted Improvement   |60%            |83%            |100%     |
|__Cost/Benefit Ratio__                                           |
|Improvement/Key        |15%            |6.9%           |3.3%     |

While it may seem remarkable that Minimak's per-key improvement is
better than that of Dvorak, it's not really.  Per-key improvement is
highest with the first 4-key layout and goes down from there.  This
makes sense because if you're designing the layout correctly, you're
using the best key changes first.

What's remarkable is that with only 12 keys you get most of the
improvement of Dvorak at nowhere near the expense of its learning curve.
This shows that you don't need to throw out QWERTY, you just need to
fix it.

More importantly, you don't need to learn the full Minimak to benefit.
You can choose the 4-key layout, never learn the rest and you still get
60% of the reduction in finger travel and same-finger repetition offered
by Dvorak.  _Anyone can handle that without losing their investment in
QWERTY, even if you don't practice maintaining your QWERTY skills_.

It's not a no-brainer, but it's close.  Put another way, you'd be better
off with QWERTY if you just left your fingers on the E and T keys and
only let them travel to the home position when you have to type D and F.
Why not just change E and T to the home position?  That's what Minimak
does, it just puts them where they do the most good.

These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer] using
Chapter 1 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text, but
they also bear out against a number of other samples representative of
everyday English usage.  "Weighted Improvement" is combination of the
improvement in finger distance (2/3) and same-finger repetition (1/3),
and are normalized so Dvorak is 100%.  Note that these metrics have
nothing to do with typing speed, only with finger movement and
repetition.

Key counts for Dvorak were calculated by only considering the keys which
were considered eligible for change when developing Minimak.  These are
the 27 letter keys and semicolon.  Dvorak actually changes more keys
outside this set (punctuation), but the count was limited to that domain
in order to keep the comparison more apples-to-apples.  This is the
conservative perspective which actually favors Dvorak.
