Minimak is a collection of 3 related keyboard layouts like Dvorak and
Colemak.  Minimak is for people who aren't happy with QWERTY.  Unlike
Dvorak and Colemak, however, Minimak is simple to learn.  Minimak also
won't jeopardize your QWERTY typing skills.

The simplest Minimak layout changes just 4 keys from QWERTY.  By
comparison, Dvorak changes 25 keys and Colemak changes 17.  This gives
you an idea of how much easier it is to get started with Minimak.

There are 8- and 12-key Minimak layouts as well, but they're completely
optional.  The initial 4-key layout gives you nearly two-thirds of the
benefit of Dvorak.  Without impairing your QWERTY skills, either.  And
that's what Minimak is all about.

If you like Minimak but you're comfortable with sacrificing a bit of
your QWERTY cred, you can move on to the more advanced Minimak layouts.
Or not.  It's up to you to find the balance with which you're
comfortable.

### Starting with Minimak

To learn Minimak, you first learn a 4-key layout.  After you've mastered
the 4-key layout, you have the option of learning more advanced Minimak
layouts or staying with the initial layout.  Each layout is progressive,
only changing four more keys than the last one.  By learning in steps of
4, there's no longer a protracted practice period before you're
proficient enough to do actual work.  You just warm up a bit and go
(although you should master each layout before moving on to the next).

It's best not to plan in advance which layout you'll end up with,
however.  With Minimak, further doesn't mean better.  Minimak is about
the balance that's right for you.  I'll explain.

### Why 4-key?

You may be thinking that a 4-key layout doesn't seem worth learning in
and of itself.

If you're willing to learn a new layout at all, then you're a rare breed
in the first place.  Congratulations.  You may not know precisely how
much of an investment of time and effort it will be, but you know it'll
probably be at least as hard as it was to learn touch-typing in the
first place (presuming you touch-type).  Because it's going to be so
hard, you want to get the most for your investment.  You'll probably
spend a lot of time figuring out what the "best" layout is.

If you do your homework, you'll encounter many layouts and as many
arguments over which layout is better.  There's no shortage of layouts
or arguments.  In the end, you'll come to your own decision, perhaps based on one
of these factors:

- which you heard of first (Dvorak)
- which has the most active community (Colemak)
- which was built by science, not man (carPalx)
- buying into the designer's rationale (if they have one)
- vaguely substantiated claims of being the best (all of them)
- some anecdotal testimonials about how great layout X is (any of them)
- etc., etc.

If you're really bold, you'll design your own layout.  It's easy enough,
and you might learn something along the way.  You'll probably want to
set up a website extolling its virtues when you're done.  Go for it,
there's no one right answer.

If you want the best though, I'll give you a tip.  Colemak's the best.
Not for every purpose, but for the metrics it does well on, it's just
about the best you can hope for.  Seriously, it's a great design.  It's
even better than Minimak if you don't live in a universe where QWERTY
matters.

Nevertheless, as soon as I started learning Colemak, I knew it wasn't
for me.  Yes, it's the best, at least, it's the best at everything but
two crucial points (for me):

- it's damn hard to learn, like any layout
- once you get good at it, if you don't practice QWERTY, you lose most
  of your skill at QWERTY

That second point isn't necessarily true, since I can only speak from my
experience.  But my experience was that I did lose my ability to type
QWERTY after I learned one of carPalx's layouts, and I'm pretty sure
Colemak would be no different.

After having been down the road of losing my QWERTY skills and having to
relearn them, I just couldn't bring myself to learn Colemak, even though
I tried.  It was too much.  I'm an IT professional, and I have to be
able to type QWERTY.  Period.  I have to be able to do my work
effectively, no matter what computer I happen to be working on.  Giving
up that ability was non-negotiable, and I didn't want to have to
practice QWERTY all the time after switching to Colemak.

That's when I turned the corner.  In my excitement to learn something
new, I'd never taken the time to see what exactly was wrong with QWERTY.
Looking at all of the criticisms leveled at QWERTY, I realized that they
were all general indictments without really spelling out what
_specifically_ was wrong with it.

Had anyone actually tried to fix QWERTY?  I couldn't find a single
proposal which attempted to improve QWERTY incrementally rather than
create something from whole cloth.  What if QWERTY could be salvaged?  

If so, it would have to remain mostly the same in order to still be able
to type it without practice.  That would mean changing only a handful of
keys.  But that could only be accomplished if what were wrong with
QWERTY could be addressed in just a handful of keys.  Had anyone
considered whether that were the case?

Apparently not.  Because as it turns out, that's precisely the case.

### Why it Works

Minimak benefits from two peculiarities, one in the English language and
the other in the QWERTY layout.

The first peculiarity is the frequency of letters in English.  You might
think that there's a fairly even distribution of letters being used, or
maybe a handful of letters that are more frequent and some that are
less.  For example, you might think the letters in this paragraph are in
the more common group, while letters like "z" and "q" are less common,
kind of like Scrabble letter scores or Wheel of Fortune picks.

Of course, it's a little bit tricky nailing down the true distribution
of letters in English.  If you go through the dictionary and count the
letters in the words, that gives every word an equal chance of being
written in practice (not to mention dropping plurals).  So you might
pick something more representative of everyday language.  But writing is
different than spoken language, so you'd have to take that into account.
And then there's writing style and vocabulary.  You're not concerned
with writing Dostoevsky or Shakespeare in your emails.  You want the
letters that you are liable to write yourself, and probably biased
toward online writing, such as email.

Since 

When you look at which letters appear
most frequently in English, two letters stand way ahead of the pack,
almost ridiculously so.  The letters "e" and "t" occur more often than
the bottom fourteen letters combined, and "e" especially more
than "t".  That's the first peculiarity.

![relief keyboard]({{urls.media}}/relief_keyboard.jpg)

![frequency]({{urls.media}}/frequency.png)

As it happens, QWERTY does a terrible job of placing those two letters.
"e" and "t" are both outside the rest position, and "t" in particular is
not only more of a stretch for your finger, it's on the index finger
which is responsible for five other keys as well, rather than the one or
two of most other fingers.  That's the other peculiarity.

As it turns out, if you just fix both of those keys, you've done most of
the job of any of the other respected layouts, and without the tortuous
process of relearning every other key on the keyboard.  All you have to
do is move "e" to the rest position and "t" off of the index finger,
preferably also to the rest position.

If, in the meantime, you can also evict your least frequently used keys
from the home position, you're doing really well.  That's what Minimak
does.  "E" replaces "k" on the right hand, which is perhaps the best
single change you can make.  "K" is one of the less frequently used keys
and has no business in the rest position.  

"T" finds a new home under your left middle finger, replacing "d".
Although "d" is not one of the infrequently used keys we were hoping
for, it's still a good trade.  It also has the benefit of keeping "t" on
a strong finger.  It's best not to move it to the weaker ring or pinky,
and we already know it can't go on the index finger.  The middle finger
is really the only choice for "e" and "t".

"D" ends up where "e" was, as it's more important than "k" and that's a
better position.  "k" ends up in "t"s position, which completes the
layout.

By making you learn only four keys at a time, Minimak does something no
other layout can.  It lets you learn while doing actual productive
work rather than just typing exercises.  This effectively doubles your
practice time.  Minimak-8 can be learned in less than half the time it
takes to master a full-keyboard layout.

Minimak is also less frustrating to learn because it's only four keys at
a time.  Less frustration means better odds that you won't give up
before you've mastered it.

None of this would matter if Minimak didn't give you a better typing
experience though.  Fortunately, most of the benefits of other layouts
can be had with just the 8-key layout.  For that matter, the 4-key
layout is good enough...it gives almost 2/3rds the benefit of Dvorak
while changing 1/6th of the keys in comparison.

Finally, Minimak prevents you from jeopardizing your QWERTY abilities.
When you learn a new layout, you are rewiring the connections between
your fingers and your brain, figuratively and perhaps literally.  You
are actively suppressing your ability to type QWERTY so you have a
chance to learn something else.  As soon as you spend a significant
amount of time doing that, you'll find that your QWERTY typing has
slowed.  When you finally learn the layout and stop using QWERTY, your
QWERTY skills will atrophy unless you take time to practice regularly.

Minimak doesn't make you do that.  Minimak emphasizes staying close to
QWERTY and only makes the changes that matter most.  By staying close to
QWERTY, your QWERTY skills don't go away, at least not nearly as much.
And if you choose Minimak-4 as your final layout, you may not need to
practice at all and still type QWERTY well.

Each change the progression of Minimak layouts has been carefully
selected to maximize the benefit of that change.  The motivation behind
Minimak is "minimum change for maximum benefit".  Said another way,
"mini-max", or Minimak as a nod to Dvorak.

If you're interested in learning what went into the design of Minimak
and how its benefits are measured, see the [design page].

If you want to download Minimak and give it a try, go to the [download
page].

If you're thinking about adopting _any_ alternative keyboard layout,
visit the [caveats page].  Changing keyboard layouts can end up biting
you when you don't expect it.  This page talks about the dangers that
apply to any alternative layout, not just Minimak.

Oh, and if you're wondering about the third layout, there is a
Minimak-12.  In keeping with the four-key progression, it employs the
four next best key changes from Minimak-8.  Although it delivers nearly
the same benefit as Dvorak and Colemak, it's far enough away from QWERTY
that I don't recommend it unless you're unsatisfied with Minimak-8 and
want to go further.

In summary, Minimak is a progressive set of alternative keyboard
layouts, each of which builds on the last while maximizing the benefits
of key changes and minimizing learning effort and impact on your QWERTY
typing abilities.  Choose whichever of them which makes you happiest;
even Minimak-4 is worth learning.  You'll feel the difference.

Of
the many metrics for layouts, there are two that most agree as being
important: finger movement and same-finger repetition.

Finger movement is the measure of how much your fingers move around on
the keyboard while you are typing.  By changing the most frequently used
keys to your fingers' rest position, your fingers spend more time in the
rest position and therefore have less distance to cover.  Reducing
unnecessary finger movement is an important goal for a good layout.

Same-finger repetition also impairs good typing.  Typing is the act of
hitting keys, representing letters of the alphabet, in succession.  In
QWERTY, the letters "g" and "r" are typed by the same finger.  When you
type "great", for example, the same finger has to hit "g" and "r" in
succession.  That's a repetition using the same finger.  It's also
slower than typing successive letters with alternate fingers.  By making
each finger responsible only for those letters that occur together less
frequently, you make typing easier.  Reducing same-finger repetition is
another important goal for a good layout.

The great thing about these metrics is not only that they are fairly
intuitive to grasp, but they also have concrete measures.  You can use a
tool like Patrick Gillespie's [keyboard layout analyzer] to put hard
numbers on them.  By mathematically combining these two metrics into a
single number somehow and then looking at how QWERTY scores as your
baseline and how Dvorak scores as your goal, you can assess how far
towards your goal any other layout gets you.

In my case, I decided I value reduction in finger movement twice as much
as I value reduction in same-finger repetition.  This gives you a
two-thirds weight for movement and one-third for repetition in a
weighted average of the two.  When you use that formula, QWERTY and
Dvorak differ by quite a bit, which is another way of saying that Dvorak
is a good layout.  Throwing the Minimak into the mix, Minimak covers
more than half of the improvement of Dvorak _with just 4 keys_.  That's
an astonishing result.

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently:

- __Dramatically cuts the learning curve:__  Minimak provides 60% of the
benefit of Dvorak by switching just 4 keys!  By prioritizing the most
frequently used keys first, practice becomes ingrained very quickly.
You can start using it in your daily routine almost immediately.
- __Compares favorably with other layouts:__  While 60% is a huge
benefit for 4 keys (what is Dvorak doing with those other 21 keys
    anyway?), you can further improve your typing experience with layout
\"upgrades\" which achieve up to 83% of the benefit of Dvorak.
- __Upgrades incrementally:__  Each upgrade changes only 4 keys at a
time, ensuring your learning experience is as quick and painless as
possible.  You can learn each upgrade without having to practice much
before adopting them into your routine.  This speeds the process as a
whole, because your learning can mostly be done while you\'re on the job.
- __Changes fewer keys:__  If you decide that the original 4-key Minimak
layout feels good enough, then stay with it.  It\'s a substantial
improvement over QWERTY.  If you go to the final upgrade however, you\'re
getting 83% of the benefit of Dvorak for only 12 keys.  That\'s less than
half the keyboard. Dvorak changes _13 more keys than that_ and provides
little more improvement.
- __Is Very QWERTY friendly:__  If you go with the 4-key layout, you\'re
still going to be able to type QWERTY without practice, perhaps just a
little more slowly.  Even the 12-key layout is easier to maintain
alongside your QWERTY skills compared to most layouts, which share
nothing with QWERTY.  But Minimak never moves more than _3 keys_ to
different fingers, in any of its configurations.  Because of this, you
learn to correct your mistakes quickly.  Since most keys stay on the same
finger, you don't have to pause and remember which other finger to try.

Minimak is simple for any typist to learn, is extremely QWERTY-friendly
and still provides considerable improvement in the important metrics for
performance (finger movement distance, same-finger repetition and
same-hand row jumps).

What Makes Minimak Unique
-------------------------

The difference is simple.  Most keyboard layouts make little or no
consideration of how hard it is to learn a new layout.  They aim to eek
out the \"best\" performance, nevermind the fact that performance is
highly subjective and difficult to quantify.

It\'s amazingly hard to learn a new keyboard layout.  It takes days,
weeks even, just to get to a speed at which you can perform
work...barely and with frustration.  Not only that, learning a new
layout actively impairs your ability to type the old layout.  It\'s a
double whammy on your productivity for months.

Not only that, other layouts assume that you\'ll never want to type
QWERTY again.  This is simply unrealistic in today\'s world where
computers abound.  You can\'t switch them all to a new layout.  QWERTY
skills are still important even when you learn an alternative keyboard
layout.

Minimak looks at things the other way around.  What\'s the most efficient
way to learn a new layout that approximates the performance of the other
layouts and lets you type QWERTY without difficulty?  While I couldn\'t
have guaranteed a good solution at the outset of the design process, I
found that the happy fact is you can create a layout which does all of
these things successfully.

Consider the following metrics:

| Metric                 | Minimak 4-key | Minimak 12-key | Dvorak |
| -                      | -             | -              | -      |
| __Cost__               |
| Keys changed           | 4             | 12             | 25     |
| Fingers changed        | 3             | 3              | 23     |
| __Benefit__            |
| Weighted Improvement   | 60%           | 83%            | 100%   |
| __Cost/Benefit Ratio__ |
| Improvement/Key        | 15%           | 6.9%           | 4%     |

What\'s remarkable is that with only 12 keys you get most of the
improvement of Dvorak at nowhere near the expense of its learning curve.
This shows that you don\'t need to throw out QWERTY, you just need to
fix it.

![Minimak Layout]{: style=\"width: 541px; height: 159px;\"}  
_Minimak 12-key layout_
{: .center }

More importantly, you don\'t need to learn the full Minimak to benefit.
You can choose the 4-key layout, never learn the rest and you still get
60% of the reduction in finger travel and same-finger repetition offered
by Dvorak.  _Anyone can handle that without losing their investment in
QWERTY, even if you don\'t practice maintaining your QWERTY skills_.

For the best results, I recommend the **Minimak 8-key layout**.  It is
learned in two steps, first the 4-key layout then the 8-key layout.  It
is simple to alternate with QWERTY and still provides the majority of
the performance of other layouts (75% of Dvorak).

There are downloads which support adopting Minimak on several platforms
in the [downloads] section.  Please read the [caveats] which explain a
number of issues with changing layouts that you\'ll want to know about.

<small>These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer]
using Chapter 1 of Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text,
but they also bear out against a number of other samples representative
of everyday English usage.  \"Weighted Improvement\" is a combination of
the improvement in finger distance (2/3) and same-finger repetition
(1/3), and is normalized so that Dvorak is 100%.  Note that these
metrics have nothing to do with typing speed, only with finger movement
and repetition.</small>

<small>Key counts for Dvorak were calculated by only considering the
keys which were considered eligible for change when developing Minimak.
These are the 27 letter keys and semicolon.  Dvorak actually changes
more keys outside this set (punctuation), but the count was limited to
that domain in order to keep the comparison more apples-to-apples.  This
is the conservative perspective which actually favors Dvorak.</small>
