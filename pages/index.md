The Benefit of Dvorak Without Losing Your Investment in QWERTY
==============================================================

![Minimak 4-key Layout]  
_The Minimak 4-key layout gives 60% of the benefit of Dvorak while
changing just 4 keys from QWERTY.  Think about that for a moment._

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently:

- __Focuses on the keys that matter:__  Minimak only changes keys that
  make a significant difference in typing.  Other layouts over-optimize,
  trying to squeeze tiny improvements out of large numbers of key
  changes.
- __Changes fewer keys:__ Other layouts usually change the entire
  keyboard.  They subscribe to the theory that there isn't "enough"
  improvement without trying to improve everything.  Minimak doesn't
  change any key that won't give a significant improvement, limiting
  itself to 12 keys in the full layout.  Fewer keys to learn means
  faster learning and better recollection of QWERTY.
- __Preserves QWERTY fingering:__ Of the 12 keys that do change in the
  full layout, _only 3_ move to a different finger.  Most just swap
  rows.  This makes it easy to correct yourself as you learn, and thus
  you learn faster.  Your initial impulses are still good, they just
  need to be modified.
- __Can be learned in steps:__  Minimak's layout is designed to be
  learned in three increments of 4-key swaps.  By limiting the amount of
  change to be learned at a time, you adapt faster.  For the gung-ho,
  there's also a 6-key layout that gets you to the full Minimak in two
  steps.
- __Can be used at any level:__  You don't have to learn the full 12-key
  layout; you can stop at any level you're comfortable with.  If you're
  on the 4-key or 8-key levels, you're already using the best layout
  possible for that number of key-swaps.  (6-key is the second best
  layout for that number of keys, but is optimized for learning
  quickly)

![Minimak 8-key Layout]  
_The Minimak 8-key layout gives about 75% of the improvement of Dvorak_

All of these elements combine to form a layout that is manageable for
anyone to learn, is extremely QWERTY-friendly and still provides
considerable improvement in finger movement distance, same-finger
repetition and same-hand row jumps.

Consider the following metrics:

|Metric                 |Minimak 4-key  |Minimak (full) |Dvorak   |
|-                      |-              |-              |-        |
|__Cost__                                                         |
|Keys changed           |4              |12             |27       |
|Fingers changed        |3              |3              |24       |
|__Benefit__                                                      |
|Weighted Improvement   |60%            |83%            |100%     |
|__Cost/Benefit Ratio__                                           |
|Improvement/Key        |15%            |6.9%           |3.3%     |

While it may seem remarkable that Minimak's per-key improvement is
better than that of Dvorak, it's not really.  Per-key improvement is
highest with the first 4-key layout and goes down from there.  This
makes sense because if you're designing the layout correctly, you're
using the best key changes first.

What's remarkable is that with only 12 keys you get most of the
improvement of Dvorak at nowhere near the expense of its learning curve.
This shows that _you don't need to throw out QWERTY, you just need to
fix it._

More importantly, you don't need to learn the full Minimak to benefit.
You can choose the 4-key layout, never learn the rest and you still get
60% of the reduction in finger travel and same-finger repetition offered
by Dvorak.  _Anyone can handle that without losing their investment in
QWERTY, even if you don't practice maintaining your QWERTY skills_.

It's not a no-brainer, but it's close.  Put another way, you'd be better
off with QWERTY if you just left your fingers on the E and T keys and
only let them travel to the home position when you have to type D and F.
Why not just change them to the home position?

These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer] using
Chapter 1 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text, but
they also bear out against a number of other samples representative of
everyday English usage.  "Weighted Improvement" is combination of the
improvement in finger distance (2/3) and same-finger repetition (1/3),
and are normalized so Dvorak is 100%.  Note that these metrics have
nothing to do with typing speed, only with finger movement and
repetition.
