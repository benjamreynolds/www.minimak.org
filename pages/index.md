Minimak: The Intuitive Alternative to QWERTY

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently:

- __Dramatically cuts the learning curve:__  Minimak provides 60% of the
benefit of Dvorak by switching just 4 keys!  By prioritizing the most
frequently used keys first, practice becomes ingrained very quickly.
You can start using it in your daily routine almost immediately.
- __Compares favorably with other layouts:__  While 60% is a huge
benefit for 4 keys (what is Dvorak doing with those other 21 keys
    anyway?), you can further improve your typing experience with layout
\"upgrades\" which achieve up to 83% of the benefit of Dvorak.
- __Upgrades incrementally:__  Each upgrade changes only 4 keys at a
time, ensuring your learning experience is as quick and painless as
possible.  You can learn each upgrade without having to practice much
before adopting them into your routine.  This speeds the process as a
whole, because your learning can mostly be done while you\'re on the job.
- __Changes fewer keys:__  If you decide that the original 4-key Minimak
layout feels good enough, then stay with it.  It\'s a substantial
improvement over QWERTY.  If you go to the final upgrade however, you\'re
getting 83% of the benefit of Dvorak for only 12 keys.  That\'s less than
half the keyboard. Dvorak changes _13 more keys than that_ and provides
little more improvement.
- __Is Very QWERTY friendly:__  If you go with the 4-key layout, you\'re
still going to be able to type QWERTY without practice, perhaps just a
little more slowly.  Even the 12-key layout is easier to maintain
alongside your QWERTY skills compared to most layouts, which share
nothing with QWERTY.  But Minimak never moves more than _3 keys_ to
different fingers, in any of its configurations.  Because of this, you
learn to correct your mistakes quickly.  Since most keys stay on the same
finger, you don't have to pause and remember which other finger to try.

Minimak is simple for any typist to learn, is extremely QWERTY-friendly
and still provides considerable improvement in the important metrics for
performance (finger movement distance, same-finger repetition and
same-hand row jumps).

What Makes Minimak Unique
-------------------------

The difference is simple.  Most keyboard layouts make little or no
consideration of how hard it is to learn a new layout.  They aim to eek
out the \"best\" performance, nevermind the fact that performance is
highly subjective and difficult to quantify.

It\'s amazingly hard to learn a new keyboard layout.  It takes days,
weeks even, just to get to a speed at which you can perform
work...barely and with frustration.  Not only that, learning a new
layout actively impairs your ability to type the old layout.  It\'s a
double whammy on your productivity for months.

Not only that, other layouts assume that you\'ll never want to type
QWERTY again.  This is simply unrealistic in today\'s world where
computers abound.  You can\'t switch them all to a new layout.  QWERTY
skills are still important even when you learn an alternative keyboard
layout.

Minimak looks at things the other way around.  What\'s the most efficient
way to learn a new layout that approximates the performance of the other
layouts and lets you type QWERTY without difficulty?  While I couldn\'t
have guaranteed a good solution at the outset of the design process, I
found that the happy fact is you can create a layout which does all of
these things successfully.

Consider the following metrics:

| Metric                 | Minimak 4-key | Minimak 12-key | Dvorak |
| -                      | -             | -              | -      |
| __Cost__               |
| Keys changed           | 4             | 12             | 25     |
| Fingers changed        | 3             | 3              | 23     |
| __Benefit__            |
| Weighted Improvement   | 60%           | 83%            | 100%   |
| __Cost/Benefit Ratio__ |
| Improvement/Key        | 15%           | 6.9%           | 4%     |

What\'s remarkable is that with only 12 keys you get most of the
improvement of Dvorak at nowhere near the expense of its learning curve.
This shows that you don\'t need to throw out QWERTY, you just need to
fix it.

More importantly, you don\'t need to learn the full Minimak to benefit.
You can choose the 4-key layout, never learn the rest and you still get
60% of the reduction in finger travel and same-finger repetition offered
by Dvorak.  _Anyone can handle that without losing their investment in
QWERTY, even if you don\'t practice maintaining your QWERTY skills_.

For the best results, I recommend the **Minimak 8-key layout**.  It is
learned in two steps, first the 4-key layout then the 8-key layout.  It
is simple to alternate with QWERTY and still provides the majority of
the performance of other layouts (75% of Dvorak).

There are downloads which support adopting Minimak on several platforms
in the [downloads] section.  Please read the [caveats] which explain a
number of issues with changing layouts that you\'ll want to know about.

<small>These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer]
using Chapter 1 of Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text,
but they also bear out against a number of other samples representative
of everyday English usage.  \"Weighted Improvement\" is a combination of
the improvement in finger distance (2/3) and same-finger repetition
(1/3), and is normalized so that Dvorak is 100%.  Note that these
metrics have nothing to do with typing speed, only with finger movement
and repetition.</small>

<small>Key counts for Dvorak were calculated by only considering the
keys which were considered eligible for change when developing Minimak.
These are the 27 letter keys and semicolon.  Dvorak actually changes
more keys outside this set (punctuation), but the count was limited to
that domain in order to keep the comparison more apples-to-apples.  This
is the conservative perspective which actually favors Dvorak.</small>
