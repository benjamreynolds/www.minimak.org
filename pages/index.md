      <h1>Minimak - Minimum Effort, Maximum Efficiency</h1>

      <p>What happened to Minimak?</p>

      <p>Minimak went through a minor revision, and then was given some
      time for dissemination.  During that time, I worked on a more full
      layout remapping for my personal use.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly, the result of that experimentation was not a 
      better remapping of the entire keyboard.  Instead,
      I just got a better understanding of what really makes a difference
      and what doesn't.</p>
      
      <p>Ironically, I determined that QWERTY <em>
      really isn't all that bad</em>, it just gets one or two things very
      wrong.  As a result, I found that you don't actually have to
      remap your entire keyboard to get the best advantages of the popular
      layout alternatives today.  You just have to fix the issues with
      QWERTY with some judicious tweaking.</p>
      
      <p>The result is a new Minimak, more
      intelligently laid out and with far fewer key changes.  That means
      it's also far easier to learn and more easily maintained along
      with regular QWERTY skills.</p>

      <p>Of course, it bears little resemblance to the former Minimak
      design, so much of what was discussed on the site before is
      in the process of being updated.  I apologize to anyone who is
      disappointed with the new materials, as they are replacing the
      old ones.  The old ones are no longer available as they are clearly
      superseded by the new design.  Thanks for your understanding and
      I hope you are interested enough to give the new design a try.</p>

      <p>Minimak is a keyboard layout.
         Minimak presents the most efficient layout that can be had
          while changing as little as possible from what you already know.</p>

          <h1>learn faster</h1>

          <p>Minimak changes only 7 of the 27 keys on the keyboard.
          They can be seen in green in the layout above.</p>
          
          <p>
          It's also Control-key friendly. The majority of
          frequently-used command combinations are unchanged.</p>

          <h1>keeping qwerty skills</h1>

          <p>Learning a new layout poses another problem for typists,
          aside from the learning curve.  Normally,
          gaining skills in another layout means losing skills in QWERTY, at least temporarily.</p>

          <p><em>Like it or not, QWERTY is and always will be the "first language" of English typing.
          </em></p>

          <p>And like it or not, you'll still have to use it occasionally.</p>

          <p>No matter which keyboard layout you choose, you're going to
          have to spend effort maintaining your QWERTY skills.  However,
          Minimak makes it easier because Minimak is based on QWERTY.</p>

          <p>Minimak isn't cut from whole cloth, it's just QWERTY
          <em>as it should have been.</em></p>
