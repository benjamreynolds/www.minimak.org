The Advantages of Dvorak, Designed So You Don\'t Forget QWERTY
=============================================================

![Minimak 4-key Layout]{: style="display:block;margin:7px auto;padding:4px;" }
_Minimak 4-key layout gives 50% of the finger distance reduction of
Simplified Dvorak with only 4 keys different than QWERTY.  Dvorak
changes 33 keys by comparison._

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently than any other popular alternative layout:

- __Focuses on the keys that matter:__  Minimak only changes keys that
  make a significant difference in typing.  Other layouts overoptimize,
  trying to squeeze tiny improvements out of large numbers of key
  changes.
- __Changes fewer keys:__ Because many key changes don't make sense,
  Minimak is able to change only 12 keys in the full layout, while still
  giving the majority of the benefit of other layouts.
- __Preserves finger impulses:__ Of the 12 keys that do change, _only 3_
  move to a different finger.  This makes it far easier to correct
  yourself as you learn, and therefore you learn faster.  Your initial
  impulses are still good, they just need to be modified.
- __Can be learned in steps:__  Minimak's layout is designed to be
  learned in increments of 4- or 6-key swaps, at your decision.  4-key
  increments allow you to use it quickly in your everyday life, while
  offering the best improvements that can be had at each step.
- __Can be used at any level:__  You don't have to learn the full 12-key
  layout, you can stop at any level you're comfortable with.  If you're
  on the 4-key or 8-key levels, you're already using the best layout
  possible for that number of key-swaps.
- __QWERTY-friendly:__  Because of the low number of key changes and the
  minimal number of finger changes, you're easily able to preserve and
  switch to your QWERTY typing skills.

![Minimak 8-key Layout]{: style="display:block;margin:7px auto;padding:4px;" }
_Minimak 8-key layout gives about 75% of the finger distance reduction of
Simplified Dvorak and 75% of same-finger repetition reduction_
{: style="text-align:center;" }

All of these elements add up to a layout that is incomparably easier to
learn than other layouts while still giving admirable improvements in
finger distance, same-finger repetition and same-hand row jumps.
Consider the following comparison:

|Metric| Minimak (full)|    Simplified Dvorak|   Colemak|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Keys changed|12|33|17|
|Fingers changed|3|28|13|
|Distance Improvement|35%|40%|42%|
|Repetition Improvement|37%|50%|60%|

As you can see, the bang for your buck on how much you get versus how
much changes is remarkable by comparison.

These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer] using
Chapter 1 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text, but
these results bear out against a number of sample inputs representative
of everyday English usage.
