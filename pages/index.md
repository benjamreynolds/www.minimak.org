      <h1>Minimak - Minimum Effort, Maximum Efficiency</h1>

      <p>Minimak is a keyboard layout.
         Minimak presents the most efficient layout that can be had
          while changing as little as possible from what you already know.</p>
          
          <p>It delivers a whopping <em>41% increase</em> in home row usage.  That reduction in finger
          movement translates into greater typing economy.</p>

      <p>Minimak is different in design from almost every other
      keyboard layout.  The difference lies in its three primary benefits:</p>

        body: |
          <h1>learn less</h1>

          <p>Minimak changes only 15 of the 27 keys on the keyboard.
          They can be seen in green in the layout above.</p>
          
          <p>Almost half of the keys on the keyboard <em>don't need to be relearned</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Minimak also keeps changed keys on the same finger, just
          in a different row, so all of your finger impulses are
          already correct.</p>

          <p><em>Your finger impulses only need to be adjusted to a different
          row, not thrown away.</em></p>

          <p>Minimak is the only keyboard layout to use this unique learning
          acceleraton technique.</p>

          <p>
          It's also Control-key friendly. The majority of
          frequently-used command combinations are unchanged.</p>

          <h1>at your pace</h1>

          <p>There are no key swaps between hands in Minimak, which means you don't have to
          learn the layout all at once.</p>
          
          <p>You can learn Minimak
          <em>one hand at a time.</em></p>

          <p>With Minimak, you just start with the left hand and
          wait to train the right until you're ready.</p>
          
          <p>This approach means
          you <em>learn faster</em>, are <em>more productive</em> and <em>less likely to
          give up.</em></p>

          <p>Because you are limiting the number of changes your brain
          has to deal with at a time, your noggin is better able to integrate
          the new layout.</p>

          <p>You end up learning Minimak faster by splitting it up into
          digestible chunks than you would by changing everything at once.  Other
          layouts can't do this.</p>

          <h1>keeping qwerty skills</h1>

          <p>Learning a new layout poses another problem for typists,
          aside from the learning curve.  Normally,
          gaining skills in another layout means losing skills in QWERTY, at least temporarily.</p>

          <p><em>Like it or not, QWERTY is and always will be the "first language" of English typing.
          </em></p>

          <p>And like it or not, you'll still have to use it occasionally.</p>

          <p>No matter which keyboard layout you choose, you're going to
          have to spend effort maintaining your QWERTY skills.  However,
          Minimak makes it easier because Minimak is based on QWERTY.</p>

          <p>Minimak isn't cut from whole cloth, it's just QWERTY
          <em>as it should have been.</em></p>
