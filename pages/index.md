Minimak - Minimum Effort, Maximum Efficiency
============================================

Minimak is a keyboard layout. Minimak presents the most efficient layout
that can be had while changing as little as possible from what you
already know.

It delivers a whopping *41% increase* in home row usage. That reduction
in finger movement translates into greater typing economy.

Minimak is different in design from almost every other keyboard layout.
The difference lies in its three primary benefits:

learn faster
============

Minimak changes only 15 of the 27 keys on the keyboard. They can be seen
in green in the layout above.

Almost half of the keys on the keyboard *don’t need to be relearned*.

Minimak also keeps changed keys on the same finger, just in a different
row, so all of your finger impulses are already correct.

*Your finger impulses only need to be adjusted to a different row, not
thrown away.*

Minimak is the only keyboard layout to use this unique learning
acceleraton technique.

It’s also Control-key friendly. The majority of frequently-used command
combinations are unchanged.

at your pace
============

There are no key swaps between hands in Minimak, which means you don’t
have to learn the layout all at once.

You can learn Minimak *one hand at a time.*

With Minimak, you just start with the left hand and wait to train the
right until you’re ready.

This approach means you *learn faster*, are *more productive* and *less
likely to give up.*

Because you are limiting the number of changes your brain has to deal
with at a time, your noggin is better able to integrate the new layout.

You end up learning Minimak faster by splitting it up into digestible
chunks than you would by changing everything at once. Minimak is the
only layout designed with this in mind.

keeping qwerty skills
=====================

Learning a new layout poses another problem for typists, aside from the
learning curve. Normally, gaining skills in another layout means losing
skills in QWERTY, at least temporarily.

*Like it or not, QWERTY is and always will be the “first language” of
English typing.*

And like it or not, you’ll still have to use it occasionally.

No matter which keyboard layout you choose, you’re going to have to
spend effort maintaining your QWERTY skills. However, Minimak makes it
easier because Minimak is based on QWERTY.

Minimak isn’t cut from whole cloth, it’s just QWERTY *as it should have
been.*
