The Benefit of Dvorak Without Losing Your Investment in QWERTY
==============================================================

![Minimak 4-key Layout]{: style="display:block;margin:7px auto;padding:4px;" }
_The Minimak 4-key layout gives 60% of the benefit of Dvorak while
changing just 4 keys from QWERTY.  Think about that for a moment._

Minimak is designed to give you the benefits of other keyboard layouts
without sacrificing your ability to type QWERTY as well.  It approaches
layout design differently:

- __Focuses on the keys that matter:__  Minimak only changes keys that
  make a significant difference in typing.  Other layouts over-optimize,
  trying to squeeze tiny improvements out of large numbers of key
  changes.
- __Changes fewer keys:__ Because other layouts don't put the same
  premium on preverving your QWERTY skills, they change keys
  unnecessarily.  With Minimak, you have the choice of 4, 8 or 12 keys
  changes.  With as few as even 4 keys changes, you still get the
  majority of the benefit of other layouts.
- __Preserves finger impulses:__ Of the 12 keys that do change in the
  full layout, _only 3_ move to a different finger.  This makes it 
  easy to correct yourself as you learn, and thus you learn faster.
  Your initial impulses are still good, they just need to be modified.
- __Can be learned in steps:__  Minimak's layout is designed to be
  learned in three increments of 4-key swaps.  By limiting the amount of
  change to be learned at a time, you adapt faster.  For the gung-ho,
  there's also a 6-key layout that gets you to the full Minimak in two
  steps.
- __Can be used at any level:__  You don't have to learn the full 12-key
  layout; you can stop at any level you're comfortable with.  If you're
  on the 4-key or 8-key levels, you're already using the best layout
  possible for that number of key-swaps.  (6-key is the second best
  layout for that number of keys, but is optimized for learning quickly)
- __Is QWERTY-friendly:__  Because of the low number of key changes and
  the minimal number of finger changes, you're able to easily preserve
  and switch to your QWERTY typing skills.

_The Minimak 8-key layout gives about 75% of the improvement of Dvorak_
{: style="text-align:center;" }

All of these elements combine to form a layout that is manageable for
anyone to learn while providing considerable improvement in finger
movement distance, same-finger repetition and same-hand row jumps.
Consider the following metrics:

|Metric                 |Minimak (full) |Simplified Dvorak  |Colemak  |
|:-                     |:-             |:-                 |:-       |
|Keys changed           |12             |27                 |17       |
|Fingers changed        |3              |24                 |13       |
|Weighted Improvement   |75%            |90%                |100%     |
|=                      |=              |=                  |=        |
|Improvement/Key        |6.3%           |3.8%               |5.9%     |
{: style="margin:0 auto;" }

While it may seem remarkable that Minimak's per-key improvement is
better than the others, it's not really.  Per-key improvement is highest
with the first 4-key layout and goes down from there.  This makes sense
because if you're designing the layout correctly, you're using the best
key changes first.

What's remarkable is that with only 12 keys you get most of the
improvement in the Colemak and Dvorak layouts at nowhere near the
expense of their learning curves.  This shows that _you don't need to
throw out QWERTY, you just need to fix it._

These results were generated with the [keyboard layout analyzer] using
Chapter 1 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the sample text, but
they also bear out against a number of other samples representative of
everyday English usage.  "Weighted Improvement" is combination of the
improvement in finger distance (2/3) and same-finger repetition (1/3),
and are normalized so Colemak is 100%.  Note that these metrics have
nothing to do with typing speed, only with finger movement and
repetition.
