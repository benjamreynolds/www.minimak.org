I've come up with a new, final version of the Minimak design.  I'm
pretty excited about it because it's a significant improvement over both
previous Minimak designs.

While it's especially painful to see a keyboard layout evolve since it's
so hard to learn any layout change, I believe Minimak has reached the
end of its design cycle.  The latest changes were driven by specific,
tangible metrics, and I think this version represents the absolute best
you can do on those metrics given the number of key changes I've
allowed.

So look for the new design in the next couple days as I get the site
content and graphics retooled and get the repository up to date.
