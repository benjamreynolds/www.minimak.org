The traffic from Jeff's tweet has been great...it's seemed to have
tapered off at about 3,100 visitors.  I also noticed about 50 people
have subscribed to the RSS feed.

The one thing I regret is that I haven't provided a good way of getting
in contact with me for issues, discussion etc., unless you count github.
Since this is a static website, I just opened a [Google Group for
Minimak].  You can reach me there.

I also haven't figured out how to get notification when there's a blog
comment, so pardon me if you go neglected for a while, I have to scan
them manually for the moment.

Cheers.
